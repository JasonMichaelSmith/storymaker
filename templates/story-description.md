Challenges:

Consistent visuals across adjacent scenes is still the biggest challenge in AI-enhanced storytelling. Better prompts and image references help smoothen things over, but the general nondeterminism and lack of greater contextual awareness means we're not quite ready for these tools to compete with major studios just yet. The hope is though, that as these tools evolve, we will be. And not only will this empower creatives to iterate faster, but writers will be able to bring their creations to life by doing only what they do best: write.
