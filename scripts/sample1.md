For days you've been trekking through the eerie, dark bushlands, not another soul in sight.

Your supplies are minimal; you have no compass; no map; no signal on your phone. You have a little food and water in your backpack, but are dreadingly aware it will only last you a few days at best.

Eventually, you part a thick clearing of bush to see an old, eerie, wooden house perched within a tall grass clearing. It's badly weathered and frayed. It doesn't look like it's been lived in for years; decades even; And despite an ominous feeling permeating from it, you have no choice but to approach. Perhaps someone who lives there has a phone you can use; or can give you directions, and fresh food and water. If only.
