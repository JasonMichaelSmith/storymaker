## The Red Star

### By J.^M. Smith

As a small child growing up in a quiet, middle-class suburban town, your life is as picturesque as they come.

You live in a classic two-storey home with a white-picked fence, antiquated window shutters, and a sprawling green garden along the front and the back, filled with well-trimmed hedges adourned with native frangipani, and serene bouquets of pastel-coloured flowers.

One night, you awaken to the sound of a strong gust of wind whistling through the bedroom window left wide open. As you leap out of bed to close it, you look up at the clear night sky, and notice something...... strange.

There, upon a sparkling canvas of cosmic diamonds, lied a blaring red star.

At first you dismiss it as a light from an aircraft, or the fire of a flare gun, but after it persisted for several moments, you realise it must in fact be part of the greater cosmos itself. Despite this bizarre anomaly, you quickly go back to sleep... as a powerful fatigue gets the better of you.

The next morning, you assume it was all part of a dream. But when you leave the house to catch the bus to school, you look up, and see the same red light on the now daylight sky.

Aboard the bus, you rally your friends and point through the window, asking them if they could see the same red light in the sky. To your amazement and utter confusion, your friends say they couldn't see a thing. Nothing. No red star in the sky.

Even in class, you can still see the omnipresent red star forever suspended in the sky, and invite your classmates for a gander. But again, no one can see the red star but you, even your teacher, who irritably asks you to sit down.

What's going on... you ask yourself. Why are you the only one who can see this anomaly? Was everyone simply playing a prank on you, or were your eyes special in some way, able to see things that others could not. Like ghosts, or cosmic phenomena not made from natural light.

In the playground you sit alone, gazing up at the red star in silence. You can't take your eyes off it. Such a simple little phenomena seemed to have consumed your life entirely.

On the bus ride home, you can still see it. Outside your bedroom window, you can still see it. You tell your parents about it, and invite them outside the front yard, pointing up at the sky. But alas, your parents don't see it either.

You have trouble sleeping that night, knowing the red star was still out there, like a terminator eye in the sky, forever watching you.

The next morning, the first thing you do is look out the window, and to your horror, the red star had become significantly bigger overnight. It was almost ten times the size, and had some visible swirling texture, almost like it were some big red ball of fire.

A comet! You realise. A comet hurtling straight for Earth! What else could it be? Your child mind is utterly terrified, immediately imagining what great destruction it would soon impose.

You wake your parents and warn them of the comet, prompting them again to look up at the sky and see it with their own eyes. But despite the fact it was significantly larger than before, they claim to see nothing at all, and give you nothing but a look of grave concern, clearly worried about your mental wellbeing. And after they had seen the real terror in your eyes, the grownups realise that you aren't pulling their leg; that you genuinely believe there is a giant comet hurtling to Earth, and they may all soon... be dead...

School is called off that morning. You're taken to a "special doctor" who specialises in psychological evaluations. You're diagnosed with high levels of anxiety, and an acute onset of schizophrenia. A treatment plan is formulated for you, including medication and follow-up Psychotherapy appointments.

On the drive home though, the red star, ever-visible outside the car window, has grown freakishly larger, to which your fear escalates to new heights, and you have a full blown panic attack, complaining that you can barely breathe.

You're taken to the hospital, and undergo several standard tests for acute psychosis.

The MRI machine was the hardest to bear, as you battled through a panicked onset of claustrophobia. Of course, they find nothing wrong with you. You're perfectly healthy as far as medical science can deduce.

At some point while waiting in the hospital, you drift off to sleep, utterly exhausted by the whole ordeal. And while slumbering away, you have a nightmare, seeing your quiet little suburban town, consumed in ashes and fire, with nothing left but an earth left to smoulder, and blackened skeletons of former homes that once stood proudly in the streets.

You awaken in a fright. You're back in your bed. Back home. Your parents must have taken you home and carried you upstairs while you slept.

Naturally, the coarse red light blaring in your peripherals prompt you to immediately turn to look out your bedroom window. And frightfully, the comet outside is so close that you can feel its blazing hot wind singe your face like flakes of fire, to which you scream and fall out of your bed.

Without thinking, you bolt out of your room, run down the hall, and bang on your parent's bedroom door.

You yell and scream that the fire is coming, and after your parents emerge to try to calm you down, you see waves of fire fly through their bedroom window, causing you to scream and run downstairs, locking yourself away in the basement.

Though being stowed away in the depths brought only temporary relief, as smoke began to billow from underneath the basement door, and the ground began to shake, as a deafening roar signalled the End of the World was nigh.

You clap your hands over your ears, and roll into a ball, retreating utterly into yourself, as there was nowhere else to go. But it's no use. You feel your eardrums begin to burst from the roaring inferno just moments away from impact. And as the basement walls blow apart in relentless fire, you feel your flesh ignite and cry out in agony. This was it. The end of your life. The end of ALL life. The end... of the world.

But within what you whole-heartedly believed were the final moments of it all, you have a temporary spark of divine clarity. Whether whispers from the universe, your guardian angel, or the Almighty himself, a profound realisation enters your psyche: telling you that despite the seemingly insurmountable power of the apocalyptic fireball, it is YOU who has the power...... not it.

Like David facing Goliath, you stand up to confront the fire unbridled, throwing up your hand in defiance, and simply yelling... NO!

The fire stops before your hand, and briefly retracts. Therein the profoundness of your power takes fruition. You realise, that the more you cowered, the more you ran, the more you refused to face your foe, the greater its power became; the greater the hold it had over you. It fed off your fear, your anxiety, your sense of helplessness; its greatest meal: your unrelenting despair.

Now, the tides had turned. As you faced your fears headlong, refusing to cower, refusing to let the fire push you deeper into yourself, slowly... you regained control; slowly... did the fires rescind back into the sky.

Back into the mere red spec upon the daylight of which you had seen the fires for the first time. Then, it disappeared. Blipped from out of existence, and the world that was left to burn unravelled backwards through time, restored to its old, youthful self.

And all you had to do was be brave in the face of adversity.
