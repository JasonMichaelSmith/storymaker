## The Cabin in the Woods

### By J.^M. Smith

For days you've been trekking through the eerie, dark bushlands. Lost, alone, and scared.

Your supplies are minimal; you have no compass; no map; no signal on your phone. You have a little food and water in your backpack, but are dreadingly aware it will only last you a few days at best.

Eventually, you part a thick clearing of bush to see an old, eerie, wooden house perched within a tall grass clearing. It's badly weathered and frayed.

You approach the front door which is cracked, splintered, and covered in mould. Clearly, no one has lived here for some time.

You turn the handle, cautiously plodding inside. It's very dark inside the abandoned abode. The only light is from the outside escaping through large cracks in the walls. There's minimal furniture besides a small dining table, a soiled rug, and old paintings from a time long past, depicting heroic tales of sailors at sea.

Suddenly, you hear the scrape of a footstep coming from an open doorway nearby, followed by the sound of clanking pots; evidently, the extra room was a cookery of some kind.

You duck down behind the cobweb-covered dining table, peering through the gaps between the table and chair legs to see what person or thing was about to emerge from the adjacent room. Every creak of the floorboards sends a jolt of fear through your body, each second stretching out into an eternity of anticipation. Then, just as you begin to wonder if it was all your imagination, a figure shrouded in darkness steps into view.

It's a woman, her silhouette framed by the dim light permeating the bleak cabin. She moves with a quiet grace, her movements fluid and deliberate. Her hair is long and tangled, cascading down her back like a waterfall of shadows. She wears a tattered dress that hangs loosely from her slender frame, the fabric threadbare and worn with age.

You don't think. You just act. You leap to your feet and bolt back out through the front door, running into the thick, gloomy foliage of the endless woods of which you had previously sought shelter from. Now, they are your one source of refuge.

You keep running until you arrive at a small swamp, surrounded by a thick wall of trees. You dive behind a large boulder nearby, desperate to catch your breath, whilst trying to stay as quiet as possible. To your relief, you don't hear the sounds of rustling feet coming from the trail behind you, so the womanly apparition from the cabin likely did not pursue.

But, alas, as you look down upon the thick swamp before you, you see a ghostly woman appear from under the water. Her black hair is covered in algae and rockweed, her face pale and sickly. Her facial features barely discernible in that sudden moment of terror.

Before you can leap to your feet, the woman springs violently from the swampy water, her mouth opening impossibly wide to swallow you whole in an endless void of darkness, an alien scream accompanying her unconscionable dread.

For a while you float in a senseless daze, barely able to comprehend the horrors which had just transpired. Surely, this was all some kind of horrific dream. Surely this can't be real. But it felt real. It felt too real to be imagined. And as you continued to drift like a lost being through space, you look up to see the same cabin once more, floating in this void of complete nothingness.

You swim up to the cabin, as there's no gravity in whatever dimension this woman's devourment had sent you. Clutching onto the steps before the door, you hoist yourself up and re-enter the floating house of which you had just fled.

Sure enough, waiting for you at the small dining table within the decrepit wooden abode, is the ghostly black-haired woman, her face ailing and cold as before, and whom had seemingly set out a fancy tea set just for two.

You feel powerless and compelled to sit opposite the feminine apparition, knowing you are trapped in whatever demonic dimension she had cast you in forevermore. She beckons you to have some tea, so you pick up the cup before you at the table. There's no tea inside, but you pretend to drink nonetheless, as though you were entertaining a whimsical child.

After a few moments of near unbearable distress, you place the cup down and ask if there's a bed that you can sleep in. Surprisingly, the apparition appeared to have understood your request, and stands up to guide you to a small room with a weathered single bed jammed depressingly in the corner.

You lie down upon the bed, signalling to the ghost that you intend to stay, to which she smiles faintly in the doorway before turning to close the door gently behind her.

With time now to think, you try to recall your steps to work out how you got here in the first place. That's when you remember two large trees in the woods, each with distinct symbols carved into their trunks. They were runic symbols, and after you had diverged off the beaten track and passed between them, an aura of darkness began to arise, alongside a faint flash of amnesia to mask the sinister shift. You were none the wiser at first, almost in a daze. But now it was all too clear. You had crossed over to a place unknown.

The two trees had been a gateway. A trap. Concealing some kind of demonic portal to another dimension of which this ghostly apparition resides. And thanks to your photographic memory, you consider if carving those very symbols on any two trees, and passing between them, just might open up the same gate to bring you home.

Convinced of your plan to escape, you slowly open the bedroom door and sneak your way back into the eerie woods permeating this dimensional perdition. With a little luck, you find a sharp stone on the ground, not too far from the cabin, and quickly locate two trees up ahead. Hurriedly, you race over and begin carving the symbols on each trunk, just as you'd remembered.

Suddenly, a ghostly shriek erupts behind you. You turn to see the woman emerge from the cabin, floating fiercely towards you. Without another thought you cast the stone to the ground and leap between the trees, just as you feel the powerful gravity of the ghost's gaping mouth trying to pull you back into the cyclical void of her being.

Upon your leap of faith, a bright white flash consumes your field of view, blinding you in a void of light. Therein, your eyes slowly adjust as a new world pierces the holy veil.

You're lying on the grass, looking up upon a vast expanse of trees in the middle of the day. The sun is out. The darkness has lifted. The eerie woods were gone. You made it.

Quickly locating the trail you had originally embarked upon, you follow it back to your car in the parking lot, pull out the keys from your backpack, and get in the car, locking the doors behind you.

Staring at the dashboard, you simply fall forward and let your head rest on the steering wheel. You will never be sure if what you had experienced was real, or merely the creation of a troubled mind. Perhaps spurred by a more severe ailment like an epileptic episode, or a fleeting coma. As you contemplate, you wisely resolve to visit the doctor upon your return home.

In any event, you had survived something surreal, something unworldly, something that will profoundly transform the rest of your life. As you'll always look back and remember that cabin in the woods, and the interdimensional terror its host imposed. An eerie blip in the universe, no doubt. A cosmic enigma embedded in an otherwise ordinary world.
