## Sierra

### By J.^M. Smith

Sierra was a natural hacker. She could break into any system.

Shew grew up in the rundown streets of southern Cyberdon in the year 2250, a city marred with poverty, oppression and suffering for most.

And for the few, the megarich, the powerful, the privileged, they lived walled off from the ubiquiotus slums at the city's core, littered with obsidian skyscrapers of abject luxury and opulence, enjoying nigh all the great technological advances of the 23rd century.

Despite Sierra being denied this part of the megacity, she always found ways to be technologically resourceful; making her own gadgets from makeshift parts and techno garbage she'd raid from industrial bins; turning ever-slowly into a cyborg herself on a quest to overcome the harsh poverties of this wretched city.

Though if there was one thing that drew her disgust more than anything else in this futuristic metropolis, it was the notorious cybervenom, an opal-coloured liquid narcotic injected directly into the bloodstream, granting its users a rapture of euphoric supremacy. A drug most popular in the slums, where addicts would often line the alleyways, scavenging for the next hit.

The kingpin who produces this unmatched euphoric, was a self-proclaimed superhuman called Xarn. A man with the most cutting-edge of cyber enhancements. The most notable of which, was an arm of golden adamantite, granting him the unprecedented strength of Hercules.

Xarn was public enemy number one for many, especially for the Resistance, a band of underground hackers, scientists, and warriors whom vow to one day upend Xarn's drug-fuelled empire once and for all.

Sierra wished to join the Resistance, and had applied many times, but was rebuffed for being too young. Though the young heroine was stubborn, and believed her rejections to be a test of some kind. After all, you don't apply to join the Resistance; they apply to you.

Thus, she had to prove herself to the Resistance in some way, she believed; potentially via some momentous act of vigilantism fraught with danger; one with no conceivable reward or recognition. Pursuit of the greater good for its own sake, was the temperament of the people who currently embody the Resistance. Sierra had to demonstrate that quality. That was her ticket in.

And she knew preciously what act of vigilantism would put her on the map: capturing the most notorious cybervenom dealer in the eastern slums: the Crimson Viper.

It wouldn't be easy. The Crimson Viper, was always guarded by a swarm of flying assault drones and military cyborgs, ready to kill on site at the smallest sign of trouble.

Nevertheless, Sierra would attempt the impossible. She would defeat the Crimson Viper's cyber armada, capture the notorious drug dealer, and haul his dispicable backside all the way to the front door of the Resistance's covert bunker if she had to.

Sierra went home to plan her attack. She lived in a prison-like fortress of tightly packed shoebox apartments, the complex resembling a large cube of volcanic-coloured rock.

Inside her modest cubile, was a tech-infused smart-home, her bed, her table, and all utilities, folding from out of the walls, utilising every square inch of space to its max.

Sierra got to work at once, designing schematics for an integrated EMP weapon via a holographic interface projected directly from her bionic eye implant. After several iterations, she ran several software algorithms to verify the viability of her design, and once the final version passed, she stored a list of all parts and resources required to build and implement her design, storing all this data in her cerebral augmentation implant.

The following morning, the young hacker scavenged for all the parts she needed and rented a do-it-yourself bionic treatment workshop for the day; a common go-to for cyber implant enthusiasts with technical know-how, who couldn't afford the necessary tools and equipment back home, or to pay for a professional bionical surgeon to perform the work at a premium.

After she was done, there was just one more thing that Sierra needed: transport. So she rented a high-tech armoured vehicle built like a vault, with an adamantine frame and high-speed engine, suitable for a getaway, and highly resistant to most modern weaponry of the 23rd century.

After giving her new wares a test run, the young hacker set out a game plan to capture the Crimson Viper. For many nights she would observe him from afar, mapping his nightly routes, discovering patterns in his routine, eventually narrowing down the optimal time and place to strike.

It would be on the corner of the grungiest alley in the eastern slums. High addict count, low visibility, dark, and farthest from any reinforcements that Xarn could muster when alerted to the dealer's capture. It was also close to a one-way road that weaved in amongst a series of back streets, enabling Sierra to transport the dealer's body away from the main roads, and thus away from eyeballs and traffic. As for the best time? Precisely midnight. That is when the Crimson Viper clocks off. The latest time was the best time.

After a few days Sierra was ready. She tested her new tech, parked her armoured vehicle not far from the alley, and sat down amongst the lining addicts awaiting the infamous dealer, attempting to blend in along side them.

When the Crimson Viper arrived, she waited for everyone else to be served first, adopted a timid demeanour when he eventually stepped up to her.

TODO.
