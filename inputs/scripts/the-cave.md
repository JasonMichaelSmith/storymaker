## The Cave

### By J.^M. Smith

You're on vacation, trekking in the Himalayas. The mountain vistas are majestic. Views fit for the gods. You're staying in a small village upon a vast mountainside. A temporary pitstop before you journey on with your fellow group of mountaineers.

One morning, you're up early, and decide to go for a short trek from the fringe, scaling a small hill of snow to capture that perfect photo of the rocky ridges to the north. Your sherpa warns you not to go far, to which you readily agree. And so you set off up the snowy knoll. The snow therein is brand new, freshly fallen from last night, powder white, like walking on a cloud.

You reach the top of the wintry hill, and bask in the tremendous view of the Himalayas' most sweeping ridge. You snap a photo, and take in a deep breath, feeling closer to God.

When you turn around to trek back to the village, something catches the corner of your eye. It's a small cave, partially hidden in the snow, only visible from where you currently stand. Being an adventurer, you decide to check it out. A slight detour, you assure yourself.

Approaching the mouth of the snowy cave, you turn on your smartphone's flashlight, shining the light into the mouth of the cavern. The cave is stunning, part-ice, part-rock, with sublime stalactites of ice and limestone.

Against your better judgement, you take a few steps inside, keen to explore just a little bit further. You tell yourself: I won’t go too far as to no longer see the exit behind me.

So you venture deeper into the mysterious ice cave, and after turning a slight corner, a glint in the distance catches the light from your phone. The glint is shaped like a crack along the wall, and is purely white, almost like a...... diamond! You’d have to get closer to confirm, but you’re almost certain that the shiny aperture along the cave wall up ahead, is nothing other than a diamond vein left untapped.

What incredible fortune, you think to yourself. Even better, you have a small knife in your back pocket. With it, you could potentially carve out a few shards of diamond for yourself, and in one happenstance encounter, just like that, you’re set for life.

You decide to do it, but to claim your prize, you have to venture much farther into the cave; so much so, that the light from the exit behind you is now but a fading porthole of light in the growing dark. Nevertheless, you’re not the least bit concerned as the grandeur of riches at the hand of this shiny carbon is within arm’s reach.

Suddenly, however, you hear loud cracks from the earth beneath you, and before you can react, you fall right through what was a thin layer of ice and snow.

A crevasse! You bump and slide down the narrow fissure before beginning to free fall inside a much larger cavern below. This is it, you think to yourself. You're finished. And as you spin for what felt like forever in the dark, you pray for a quick death, or perhaps, by some miracle, a soft landing.

Indeed, by the grace of the Almighty, the first thing you hit is a soft, thin layer of snow and brittle ice before your body plunges into a body of water at subzero temperatures. As pure adrenaline kicks in, you swim to the surface, and manage to claw your way out of the icy water. As you roll over on the snowy shoreline, catching your breath, you eventually stand up to find yourself overlooking a vast ice lake deep in the mountain cavern. The lake was, admittedly, a stunning sight to behold. But of course, all you could think about is how close you came to death, and how you can’t help but believe that greater powers were teaching you a lesson: you went after the shiny prize, ignoring potential dangers up ahead. A metaphor for life.

In any event, there was no way for you to climb your way back up to the surface. Your sherpa would soon come looking for you back at the village, discover your footprints, and discover the cave. You’d just have to sit tight and wait to be rescued.

But, to your horror, the ground begins to shake. You look up to see an avalanche of rock and snow plummet through the cavern ceiling, causing the roof to soon collapse with it.

You turn and run deeper into the cavern, through a narrow opening away from the lake while the cave-in rapidly approaches. A moment later, and you would have been buried alive. To your relief, the narrow tunnel provided sufficient cover from the avalanche, and was too sturdy to collapse alongside the cavern with the lake. And while your heart thundered once more from another near-death experience, you slowly make your way through the unknown, venturing deeper into the abyss.

Emerging out the other side of the tunnel, you're greeted with another vast cavern, adourned with the most stunning sight you've ever seen: diamonds. They were everywhere. Diamonds across the ice and snow, up along the walls, and across the cavern ceiling. This place, quite literally, was like a giant diamond geode. In complete awe, and with no way back, you journey onward through the newfound sublimity, trekking with wonder through the diamond-studded cavern. Even with only the light of your phone, the diamonds acted like powerful mirrors, refracting the light indefinitely, giving the cavern a heavenly white shimmer. But the celestial palace was a deathtrap in disguise, for there were no other connecting tunnels, no other way out but the way you came. You were trapped. Trapped inside a place with riches beyond your imagining, of which you could never reap the rewards. A cruel irony.

You curl up into a ball within the centre of the cavern, laying down in the foetal position, preserving as much energy as possible. You know that without food or water you won't survive for more than a few days at best. And so you accept your fate, praying for a miracle as you slowly drift... into oblivion...... Later, you awaken to the sound of shuffling rocks, stone, and ice. You peel your face off the floor, and allow your eyes to adjust.

To your amazement and horror, you are surrounded by dozens of human-like beings made from pure diamond. They appeared non-hostile and passive, merely observing you curiously. You don't move. You don't speak. You don't do a thing. After all, there was nowhere to go. Nowhere to run...... That's when a larger crystal golem stepped forward, clearly the leader. It was holding a rocky tablet in its hands, with a carved drawing on its face. The drawing was simple: it showed the image of a man and a diamond, with a symbol separating the two, appearing to convey a transformation of some kind.

The golem then pointed to the right, where a custom-made crystal podium sat with a diamond altar. It was trying to say something, and the communication was all too clear: the golems were offering me a chance to become one with them. Man to diamond. Flesh to rock. A simple ritual. A one-way trip to immortality, but with a catch: you would no longer be human; without flesh, blood, spirit, or a soul.

You shake your head, terrified at the prospect. Leaping to your feet, you attempt to run out of pure instinctual fear; the fear of losing your humanity, a fate perhaps worse than death itself. The golems did not resist, nor try to stop you. In fact, they moved aside to let you roam wherever you please. But of course, there was nowhere to escape from in this giant diamond cavern, and after the adrenaline fades once more, and your rational mind returns, you realise it comes down to a simple choice: die from dehydration or hunger in slow agony, or become one with the diamond beings, and live on as something else, seemingly forever, or for many billions of years at least, until the universe or the world itself comes to an end.

Reluctantly, you return to the head golem, gently nod your head, and willingly mount the diamond altar afar. The golems move to surround the podium, with the leader stepping up beside you. The ritual was due to begin; a transmutation from flesh to pure carbon. The diamond golem reaches out, and with its gemstone hands, gently touches your forehead.

You feel your mind lift into a hallucinogenic dreamworld, with a powerful holy light encompassing your psyche, as if you were ascending unto the light in death of the old, to be reborn into the new.

When you awaken, you stand up from the altar, and glance down as you raise your hands. You see before you, nay hands of flesh and blood, but hands of pure diamond. Surprisingly, the sight doesn't shock you, nor do you feel anything at all. You're alive in the purest sense, a consciousness permeating the quantum composition of your new carbon frame, but you no longer feel... what a human feels. You're simply conscious to the objective realm, conscious of being an ethereal spirit inside a lifeless element. You can't see with eyes either in the traditional sense, but see by being connected to the earth, acutely aware of every atom, and its place in the greater universe.

With the ritual complete, the diamond golems return to their designated spots in the cavern, transforming back into the inanimate natural-looking chunks of diamond they once were; to no longer bare any visible signs of life.

You turn your own diamond head toward a vacant clearing of smooth rock in the corner of the cavern, and move toward it. Following the suit of your new peers, you intuitively know how to transform into your own motionless chunk of carbon, and do so dutifully as if compelled by an external force. Now, both yourself, and the horde of diamond golems, are but lifeless forms of shiny rock, only to move again if life were to find this cavern, and be chosen next to join this secret league of diamond eternals.

Your last thought before your carbon body takes root, and your consciousness flows through the earth, one with the world and mother earth, is that there is a profound moral to this story. A lesson. One that you can't properly fathom on a human level anymore, but can still appreciate to some degree. For in the end, you became the very thing you so recklessly sought to acquire, without regard for the life or body that you were humbly given. Was this eternal penance for your stark display of unmitigated greed? Maybe. In any case, the choices we make can have consequences beyond our abilities to fathom, solidifying outside our capacity to undo after we dawn on our mistakes. But the universe goes on. Time goes on. Life goes on. And in time, no matter how ruinous our fates may appear, there is divine purpose to it all; of all things good and bad, light and dark. In time, we shall all see this grander scheme, and prove to be immortals like the purest elements that bind us all.
