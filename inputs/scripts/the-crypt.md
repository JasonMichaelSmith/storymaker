## The Crypt

### By J.^M. Smith

You awaken with a blistering headache, inside what looked like some kind of damp moss-ridden cave, your face stuck to the hard stone floor.

As you recover your bearings, and your eyes refocus, you look up to see a narrow opening of light up above, a sliver of sky or daylight beckoning from beyond the confines of the cave. While you don't remember how you got here, or what you were doing, you deduce that you had fallen into some kind of pit, and that the bump to the head has caused an acute sense of amnesia.

You yell and scream up at the small aperture of light, hoping that maybe someone was above to hear you. The rocky walls of the pit leading to the cave were too wet, rough, and jagged to scale without equipment, so unless you were to be rescued, you were almost certainly trapped down in this unknown abyss.

Did anyone know you were gone? If so, did they know where? They'd come looking for you soon enough, surely. You just had to stay put and wait. But what if they didn't? You can't remember what you were doing, where you were, or even, where you lived. So what if you were wholly alone before you had fallen, and no one knew where you'd gone? What if no one was coming? What were you going to do?

You had no supplies on you. Not even a phone. Just the clothes off your back, and a knife in your pocket.

You turn away from the pit and gaze down a narrow cavern. The cave extended on into the darkness. Perhaps if you ventured on, you'd find a path that would lead you out.

The tunnel extended seemingly forever, and the further you trekked deeper into the unknown, the colder and drier it became.

Soon, the narrow cavern expanded into something incredibly sinister; something you did not expect: a catacomb. There were carved recesses on both sides of the cavern wall for graves, stretching as far as the eye could see, most of which were filled with the remains of people that you assume were from an ancient time. Furthermore, some of the skeletons were clearly of children, which made you sick to your stomach.

Terrified, you pressed on. You had to. If other human beings were down here aeons ago, perhaps you could find some supplies, like rope, or a ladder, or another means to escape this abyss.

Speaking of which, one of the small recesses nearby caught your eye, for beside the remains of an adult skeleton, was an old silver lighter.

You pick it up without question, and, to your amazement, it still works! Thank god, now you have some light for the greater depths, for the natural light from the pit entrance was growing distant, and you estimate that it would soon be dark out anyway. And so, with the lighter raised before you, you journey on deeper into the unknown.

Soon, you emerge upon a large room, filled with dozens of stone sarcophagi, with decorative wall recesses and large columns reaching up to meet an arched rooftop. It was an ancient crypt, beautifully built for its time. You're both awe-inspired and deeply afraid, yet determined to move forward all the same, as you realise the lighter in your hand felt suspiciously light, prompting you to wonder how much lighter fuel you had left.

Toward the end of the sinister expanse, you turn to see one of the stone coffins was open, with its lid slid aside just enough for you to see it was empty inside. You shiver as your imagination runs wild with possible theories: grave robbers? an ancient mummy risen from the dead? As your mind wrestled with the fearful prospects, almost on cue did the sound of shuffling stone echo behind you, to which you spin around in a fright.

The silhouette of a dark figure walking down a narrow hall causes your heart to leap into your throat. A figure with strange glowing white eyes, and no visible face.

Without another thought you bolt down the opposite hall, which quickly becomes coarse and claustrophobic, with a series of large columns decorated with human skulls. The bowels of the crypt.

You weaved in amongst the terrifying tunnels and their stark displays of death, soon finding a set of steps descending further into the dark. You hesitate initially, as your instincts tell you to not venture any deeper into this forsaken place, but after turning around, you see something that swiftly changes your mind.

You see the apparition emerge from behind a pillar of skulls, its form more horrifying than ever, as its gaping mouth was open with a blaring white light, wailing a demonic cry straight from the depths of perdition.

You plunge down the steps in a panic, tripping and rolling toward the bottom. You groan from the pain which is quickly numbed by pure adrenaline, surging you to your feet as you limp to escape the pursuing horror.

At the base of the steps, you're greeted with a prestigious hall of the damned, with towering walls and columns adourned with intricate stone carvings and sculptures paying homage to the earliest of gods. At the centre of the chamber, upon a raised podium, was a single wooden coffin, intricately designed with detailed carvings depicting great historical events, and covered in lines of a runic language along every side and edge.

As you race onto the stage, looking for a place to hide, you are intuitively drawn to the runic carvings on the coffin. You can't explain why, but you somehow understand what the runes signify, reading them with ease. Simply put, their message translated to: "May this seal ward the darkness forever more, in the name of the Holy Spirit."

It was a holy seal. One made by a ritual of High Priests during the Holy Wars, forged to protect the soul of a king or queen laid to rest, which explained this extravagant tomb. Again, how you knew this you weren't sure, as your amnesia had yet to lift from your clouded mind, but you were clearly some kind of authority of ancient history.

Shortly, the sound of shuffling footsteps, followed by a gruesome moan, emanated from the stairwell. The shadowy demon was nigh, and in a moment of pure clarity sprouting from raw panic, you realised there was only _one_ place you'd be safe from the living darkness: inside the coffin; after all, it had a seal to protect its current occupant from any such unholy threats from the outside.

Without another word, you slide the lid off the sole coffin, soon to gaze upon the remains inside. The human skeleton wore royal garments, and had a golden crown affixed to its head. Indeed this was a king. Perhaps the greatest of kings.

But as you reach in to remove the remains to make room for yourself, the dead king suddenly shoots up, rising from the coffin, clutching an obsidian sceptre that was by its side the whole time. You fall over backwards in complete and utter shock. The dead king was alive! or more accurately... he was of the undead. And before your mind could even begin to catch up with what you were seeing.

The dark apparition that was following you earlier harmlessly floated to be beside the king, with features now resembling an undead woman in black medieval garments...... they were husband and wife.

That's when you dreadingly realised that the runic message upon the coffin was not intended to ward the darkness from the outside, but from within. You had been intentionally herded into this very room in the hope that you, a being of life, of light and purity who was worthy to lay hands on the holy seal, would unwittingly free the lich from its prison, releasing an ancient evil from aeons ago.

The dead king looked down upon you with its soulless eye sockets, and waved its black staff before you, speaking but few words: "It was long foretold that the one to one day free me from this eternal prison may be granted eternal life as a lich, just like me, second of my kind, and together, we will have the powers at last to cast this world into oblivion."

The dead king was no ordinary king. He was a sorcerer from the earliest of times. A wizard who was already long dead before being captured and sealed away in his holy coffin, living indefinitely as the undead to acquire an infinity of time to hone his craft. He was a lich...... and by the sounds of it, one of an existential kind of evil.

The unholy duo appeared to await your decision, and as you glanced down at your hands rapidly wasting away to become that of the undead, you feel evil thoughts begin to blossom in your mind; thoughts of decimating all mankind; all that was good in the world; and being euphoric of wielding such dominance while being drunk with the arcane powers of a demigod.

You know in your heart what you're supposed to do, and while you still have a flicker of virtue left in your psyche, you leap into the open coffin, and slide the wooden lid shut from the inside, sealing yourself in the prison of which you had just freed the former lich.

Soon thereafter did you hear an evil cackle from outside the coffin, followed by a loud crack that had erupted from the lich's staff, as a giant swirling vortex appeared to swallow the duo whole. They were gone.

And so only you now remain trapped in this remote mausoleum, and as the last of your mind transforms into a madman sorcerer of ancient time, your amnesia briefly lifts to reveal who you truly are.

You are, or were, an archaeologist who sought out to find this remote crypt specifically, and after finding it, you had lost your balance and fallen into the pit while setting up climbing ropes and rappelling gear around a nearby tree.

You did have a partner back home, who will inevitably come looking for you. Perhaps even stumble upon the crypt, getting stuck like you, to die in the abyss and become the new dark apparition to haunt passing travellers into freeing their trapped beloved. A cycle of eras doomed to repeat.

In any event, you were trapped; trapped for an eternity as a lich, the seal averse to your now-evil. And if you were never to be freed by the next unwitting adventurer, you could only hope that the world would one day come to an end to free you from this oblivion, despite your own self-imprisonment to help prevent that very outcome. C'est la vie: Such is life.
